# Loop examples:
"""
1. Write a Python code that takes an integer from user and prints number of digits in that integer.
2. Write down a Python code that creates a user defined list
3. Write a Python code to print each of the elements of a given list in a new line
4. Write a Python program that prints whether the number given is a prime number or not.
5. Write a Python program that prints whether the number given is a perfect number or not.
6. Write a Python program that prints whether the number given is an Armstrong number or not.
7. Write a Python program that prints all the prime numbers between two integers given by user.
8. Write a Python program that prints all the perfect numbers between two integers given by user.
9. Write a Python program that prints all the Armstrong numbers between two integers given by user.
10. Ask an integer n from user. Print the following sequence seperated by comma (,) up to n. Make sure your code doesn't print comma after the last number.
	1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43
"""

# Advanced examples of List and Dictionary:
"""
1. Create a Python program to generate user-defined set. Then ask user to eneter any value & check if the given value is present in a set or not.

2. Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in a list. Now, copy all the elements in another list but in reverse order.

3. Use dictionary to store antonyms of words. E.g.- 'Right':'Left', 'Up':'Down', etc. Display all words and then ask user to enter a word and display antonym of it.

4. Ask user to give name and marks of 10 different students. Store them in dictionary.

5. Sort the above dictionary by the names of students.

6. Sort the dictionary in ex-5 by the marks.

7. Make a Python program to count letters of the word: MISSISSIPPI. Your program should store them in a dictionary as: {"M":1, "I":4, "S":4, "P":2}. Next, generalize this program for any word entered by user.

8.  Make a list containing of only strings. Now ask user for any string and re-arrange the list in the decending order of occurance of that string.

for example:
list1 = ['no bun', 'bug bun bug bun bug bug', 'bunny bug', 'buggy bug bug buggy']
input string = 'bug'
output list = ['bug bun bug bun bug bug', 'buggy bug bug buggy', 'bunny bug', 'no bun']

input string = 'bun'
output list = ['bug bun bug bun bug bug', 'bunny bug', 'no bun', 'buggy bug bug buggy']

9. Write a Python program to split a given dictionary of lists into list of dictionaries.
Original dictionary of lists:
{'Science': [88, 89, 62, 95], 'Language': [77, 78, 84, 80]}
Split said dictionary of lists into list of dictionaries:
[{'Science': 88, 'Language': 77}, {'Science': 89, 'Language': 78}, {'Science': 62, 'Language': 84}, {'Science': 95, 'Language': 80}]
"""

# Functions Examples:

"""
1. Ask two integers from user, add their factroials. Now ask two more integers from user and add their factorials too. calculate average of the factorials you computed. Now finally ask one last integer from user and add its factorial to the average.
